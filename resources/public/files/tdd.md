# Test Driven Development and Refactoring
A 2-3 day course in which students will
learn the fundamental skills of Test Driven Development and Refactoring.

**Audience:** 
* Programmers of all levels of experience who desire to improve their coding skills._

**Duration:** 
* The two day version is weighted towards lecture and demonstration with a minimum of exercises.
* The three day version shifts the weight towards in-class practice and exercises, without
diminishing the lectures and demonstrations.

**Outcomes** <br>
After this class students will:
* ...understand how, when, and when not to refactor code.
* ...be able to refactor functions and classes into cleaner, more understandable forms.
* ...know, and be able to execute the three laws of Test Driven Development.
* ...be able to create test suites that enable refactoring.
* ...understand the basics of mocking and test-doubling in order to test the 
interplay between components.
* ...be able to properly organize robust test suites.
* ...understand, and be able to employ, the strategy for testing and refactoring legacy code.
