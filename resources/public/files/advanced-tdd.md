# Advanced Test Driven Development
A 2-3 day course in which students will extend their existing skills in Test Driven Development.

This course is not a simple lecture and exercise course.  It may be better to
think of it as a workshop and conference.  Although the instructor is deeply
experienced in the topic, and will offer lectures and lessons, much of the benefit of this course
will derive from the discussions and testimonies of the students.  The instructor will endeavor
to get the students talking about the problems they have faced, and the solutions they have found
to address those problems.  

**Audience:** 
* Programmers with at least 1 year experience with TDD._

**Duration:** 
* The two day version is weighted towards lecture, discussion, and demonstration with a minimum of exercises.
* The three day version shifts the weight towards in-class practice and exercises, without diminishing the lectures and demonstrations.

**Outcomes** <br>
After this class students will:
* ...Discuss, and find solutions to, fears, concerns, confounds, and blockages in the use of TDD.
* ...Understand the underlying professional motivation behind TDD.
* ...Gain a deeper understanding of the Three Laws of TDD.
* ...Learn why clean tests are important, what makes tests clean, and the principles for designing clean tests.
* ...Explore the topic of Mocking and Stubbing, and learn the subtleties of how and when to use apply them.
* ...Understand the differing strategies of state-ism and mock-ism.
* ...Explore best practices and  conventions used in the naming and writing of tests.
* ...Understand the causes and solutions of "fragile" tests.
* ...Learn various metrics and tools for measuring and enhancing the benefits of TDD.
* ...Learn the difference between BDD and TDD.
* ...Understand the strategies for testing GUIs, Databases, and other difficult-to-test areas.
* ...Gain insight into the overall testing strategy of the project, the product, and the team.
* ...Be able to deal with Legacy Code.
* ...Learn how to teach and lead others to practice TDD.
