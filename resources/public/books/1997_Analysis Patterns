:description "
An extremely important and vastly under-utilized book.  _Analysis Patterns_ is the harbinger of _Domain Driven Design_
and provides a deep look into the most common data and behavior models for real business applications.  In this book
the author draws from decades of experience with real applications. He shows, with his usual clarity and dexterity, the
traps that you can easily fall into during the exploration of a business domain; and how to avoid them using simple
models of data and behavior.<br><br>
This is a _must read_ for any software developer of more than 2 years experience.
