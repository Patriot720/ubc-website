:description "
Probably the most important software design book written
within the last half decade.  This book contains nothing
new or revolutionary.  Rather it documents a set of tried
and true techniques for solving common well-known problems
of software design.

The techniques are given cannonical names and cannonical forms
so that designers can recognize them and converse about them.

All software developers should know and understand these patterns
and be able to apply them in their designs, and converse about them
with other developers.

This is minimum critical knowledge.
