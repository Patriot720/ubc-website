This book was life changing.  Or at least it was career modifying. It was
my first introduction to functional programming; though neither the
title, nor the first two chapters mentioned the term.

The book is completely unapologetic in it's approach, giving no quarter
to those who want an easy ride.  It moves at light speed from one topic
to the next, demonstrating concept after concept with clear, concise,
and plentiful code.

The language of the book is `Scheme`; but the reader barely notices
because the language is so lightweight, and because the topics are so intense.

I read this book with a kind of ecstatic energy -- virtually throwing
the pages from one to the next in my enthusiasm.  And then at page 217 the authors slammed
on the brakes, apologized profusely for what they were about to do to me,
and then introduced the first assignment statement.

_I was thunderstruck._  While reading all the previous code I had not
realized that they had not used assignment.  I had to go back and check.

It was then -- quite late in my career -- that I realized that
Functional Programming was important for me to learn."
