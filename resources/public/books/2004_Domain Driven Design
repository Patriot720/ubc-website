This is the definitive work on domain analysis.  It provides both the motivation for, and the techniques that support,
the analysis of an automated business domain.  The book is deeply technical, and yet covers the behavior of the
business and the development team in it's broad scope.  The writing style is engaging, and the information content is
extremely rich.

This book is an invaluable resource for developers on the path to becoming technical leads and architects.  It's the
kind of book that you'll come back to over and over as you gain systems experience.
