:description "This is the book in which Dijkstra told us that `goto` might not
be such a good idea.  This is also the book in which Ole-Johan Dahl described the
early principles of Object-Oriented Programming.  There is much wealth within these pages
that all who aspire to Software Craftsmanship should be familiar with."
