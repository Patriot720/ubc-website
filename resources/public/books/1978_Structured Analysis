:description "
This is a classic of early software system design.  DeMarco describes
the top-down approach of _functional decomposition_ and introduces
the use of _Data Flow Diagrams_ and _Data Dictionaries_ to specify that
decomposition.

The book is very approachable, and full of deep insights. Every
programmer ought to be familiar with it.
