The book walks through the basics of data structures and computational
number theory.  Topics covered include stacks, queues, linked lists, doubly linked lists, trees, etc.

These are basics that every programmer needs to know.

The other books in this series include: _Sorting and Searching_ and _Seminumerical Algorithms_.
Each is fascinating in it's own regard and ought to be part of the repertoire of knowledge
that every programmer is familiar with.
