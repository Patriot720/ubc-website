60-90 min.

In this talk Uncle Bob talks about what makes functions clean.  He addresses the size of functions,
the content of functions, the names of functions, the arguments of functions, and just about
everything else that can be crammed into an hour long talk about functions.  

One thing is sure.  After you've listened to this talk, you'll never think about functions the same
way again.
