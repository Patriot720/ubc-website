# Clean Code

A 2-3 day course for programmers that describes the basic attributes of well-written code.

**Audience:** 
* Programmers of all levels of experience who desire to improve the most fundamental
of their skills: _Writing good, clean code._

**Duration:** 
* The two day version is weighted towards lecture and demonstration with a minimum of exercises.
* The three day version shifts the weight towards in-class practice and exercises, without
diminishing the lectures and demonstrations.

**Outcomes** <br>
After this class students will be:
* ...able to recognize the elements of bad code, including within functions, classes, 
arguments, and comments.
* ...able to review code with an eye towards cleanliness and design.
* ...able to plan and execute code cleanup without risk to the application.
* ...able to incrementally improve bad design choices.
* ...much more aware of the quality of the code they, and their team-mates are writing.

## Outline ##
* **What does it mean to be clean?** <br>
This is a discussion of the motivation, costs, and benefits of keeping code clean.
Several different scenarios and principles are discussed.
 * The business cost of bad code.
  * The Productivity Roller-Coaster.
  * Race to the Bottom.
  * The Grand-Redesign Myth.
 * Why Does Code Rot?
 * The Only Way to go Fast...
<p>
* **What is Clean Code?** <br>
This section is based on interviews with many famous programmers.  The conclusion is:
 * The Boy Scout Rule: "_Check the code in cleaner than you checked it out._"
 <p>
* **Bad Code Dumpster Dive.**<br>
A 1-2 hour, character-by-character on-screen walk-through of some very bad code.  The problems
 with this code, and the motivations of the programmer are discussed in detail. 
<p>
* **Names.**<br>  
This is derived from Tim Ottinger's famous paper describing naming rules for variables,
classes, and functions. Among the topics discussed are:
 * Name length for variables, functions, and classes.
 * Revealing Intent.
 * Ubiquitous Language.
 * Optical Illusions and Disinformation.
 * No More Hungarian Notation.
 * Meaningful Distinctions.
 <p>
* **Functions.** <br>
This section is about functions should be structured and composed.  Much time is spent on
the need to keep functions small and expressive.
 * Smallness.
 * The Step-down Rule.
 * Do One Thing.
 * Extract till you Drop.
 * Avoid Switch Statements.
 * Arguments: Good and Bad.
 * Side Effects
 * Command-Query Separation.
 * Exceptions.
 * Tell-Don't-Ask.
 * Code Duplication: DRY.
 * Structured Programming
<p>
* **Demonstration: Cleaning Code.** <br>
A 1-2 hour on-screen demonstration of how bad code can be quickly and competently cleaned; 
without fear..
<p>
* **Comments** <br>
This sections is about the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to comments.  
The overriding principle of this section is that comments are are not pure good.
 * Examples of bad comments.
 * Examples of good comments.
<p>
* **Formatting** <br>
This section is about the proper formatting of source files.  In it we discuss a statistical
study of many different projects, and the formatting rules that study implies.
 * File size.
 * Vertical Formatting.
 * Horizontal Formatting.
 * Coding Standards.
<p>
* **Practice** <br>
Techniques for practicing and improving good coding skills.
<p>
* **Exercises.** <br>
Several coding exercises and demonstrations as time permits.
