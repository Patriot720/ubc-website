Uncle Bob _loves_ to speak at user groups and meet-ups.  If you'd like to invite him to talk, you can
contact his diligent and delightful assistant (and daughter) Angela Brooks at [angela@cleancoder.com](mailto:angela@cleancoder.com).

If your meet-up is within the red circle below (and even it it's not), he'll try to fly in for free.
